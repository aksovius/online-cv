        My Master's degree in Smart City, under the expert supervision of Professor
        Soonwook Kwon, was a rigorous academic endeavor that honed my expertise in the
        niche field of Smart Construction Management. My thesis, titled "Synthetic Data
        and Computer-Vision-Based Automated Quality Inspection System for Reused
        Scaffolding," underscored my commitment to advancing computer vision
        applications in the construction industry.

          - Developed a novel system to automate the quality inspection of scaffolding
            materials using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, significantly
            reducing inspection time and improving safety standards.
          - Pioneered the use of synthetic data to train machine learning models,
            overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in the construction field.
          - Contributed to the body of knowledge in smart construction by integrating
            advanced computer vision algorithms into practical tools for smart city
            development.
